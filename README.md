Planning to travel Udaipur !! Must do These activities

1. City Palace-City Palace is an impeccable piece of art and design. Chivalrously flaunting its comeliness on the banks of Lake Pichola this majestic palace is in itself a masterpiece.

2. Jag Mandir- A 400-year-old magnificent heritage palace, still thriving its charm from the 17th century, the Jagmandir Island Palace is also known as "Swarg Ki Vatika '' or ''Garden of Heaven'â€˜. This heritage island palace has been redefined into a full-fledged 5-star property

3. Moti Magri - The sumptuous green ambience of the hill hosts a palace called Moti Mahal, which once harboured Maharana Udai Singh II. Now, this Moti Mahal displays a light and sound show every evening around 8.15 pm in summers and 7.30 pm in winters.

4. Monsoon Palace - Built in the year 1884 by Maharana Sajjan Singh, the Monsoon Palace or Sajjangarh Fort is a delight.
